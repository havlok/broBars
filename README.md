# broBars

Ever wanted to join a 40 man BG with your buddies, but not have to sort through 30-some other unitframes just to see if you can heal/dispel your friends?  This addon was created for that exact purpose.  It mimics certain parts of partyframe-like functionality, while being in any size group with those you want to keep track of.

Please note:  this is very much a work-in-progress, and as such there are no guarantees of it working.  I made this addon for myself and my friends.  I will provide no warranty that this won't break your WoW installation, eat your fries, or set your cat on fire.  That having been said, I will always do my best to release a working version to the best of my (currently limited) abilities.  If you have any questions/criticisms/suggestions, please feel free to submit a new issue.  Also, I'm releasing this under the MIT License, so do feel free to fork this code or whatever, within the confines of the license.

## Features
